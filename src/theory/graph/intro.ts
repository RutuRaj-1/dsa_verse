    "A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It is used to represent relationships, networks, and connections between entities.",

      body: "These represent entities or points in the graph. Examples: cities, users, devices.",

      body: "Edges represent the connection or relationship between two nodes.",

      heading: "Undirected Graph",
      body: "Edges have no direction. A connection A—B means A is connected to B and also B to A.",

      heading: "Directed Graph (Digraph)",
      body: "Edges have direction. A → B means movement or dependency flows from A to B.",

      body: "Each edge has a cost or weight. Common in shortest-path problems.",
