  pseudocode: `for i from 1 to n-1:

  while j >= 0 and A[j] > key:
    A[j+1] = A[j]

  notes: [
    "Excellent on tiny arrays and nearly-sorted data.",
    "Often used as the base case inside faster algorithms (e.g., TimSort, quick/merge cutovers).",
    "Fewer writes than bubble sort; adaptive with respect to existing order.",
